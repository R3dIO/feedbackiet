no weakness.
No weakness found uptill now
the level of teaching is very high level which is not adequate for every student and the test questions given by him are also not appropriate
"poor communication skills, cannot explain the concept properly, no one can understand what he is teaching, he could not develop interest in students. "
"she can't explain properly, and deducts marks just because of writing...seriously, if I'm writing a program the computer won't say i don't like ur hw."
Bad writing nd use of small characters on white board confuses us to copy pseudocode :( majority of students cant write code on his teachings. BADLUCK
nothing but he is not perfect teacher for data structure......
not a perfact teacher in data sturcture...............
does not explain normal codes .. does not give proper understanding of the subject does not explain the codes .. doesnt give good notes .. n
"unable to forward knowledge to students , cannot clear concepts , inefficient teaching unable to understand, "
"inability to bring conceptual clarity, "
he is not explain very well and very fast teaching student can not understand in well manner.
no
"weak in teaching students according to their level,all students cannot learn at the level of iit..so try to teach them according to their current stat"
to make student understood about topic
he is not explain very well.
dont know
more explanation 
he sets extremely tuff exam according to what he teaches
knwolegde is good but unable to explain in the writeway so that student can ynderstand the things easily . 
program clarity is not good
"run the syllabus , doesn't teach for knowledge f student teach for completion of syllabus"
Communication skills
sets very tough mid term tests.
"He interprets the level of all students on the basis of understanding capabilities of toppers, making it difficult to understand in class."
sometimes unable to clear some concepts
"paper given is of high order thinking skills,it should be moderate so that we will be able to  get score enough marks"
Sir always thinks that everyone knows everything but that's not true. Three-Four Students shaking their head in yes dosent prove everyone got it.
his level of test paper is too high not suitable for all kind of students 
not yet be judged

He is not explaining us the topic very well or good and he teaches very minimum topics related to chapter.
interaction with student is not good and classes do not go with exact time period so many difficulty rises in front of student and it skill is weak...
waekness is the regularity and punctuality.
Does not cover whole syllabus and is irregular.does not clear doubts in exam copies i.e. the reason of deducting marks.

she does not interact with alll the students well .she talks with  selected boys and girls and does not give attention to rest other.
