The best teacher who has ever taught us in these 4 years. Massive respect for her. Would always remember her as my guiding light. :)
the chemistry taught by sir is excellent; subject become intresting
the class dont even knows the topics comming in exam no class taken regularlyand if taken the subject is not taught
the course focusses more on optics. Reduce its topics.
The course is adequate to be taught
the course is bit lengthy for the students
the course is great but not the teacher
the course is very lengthy as per the time provided 
The course is way too much. Should be less.
the course should be completed before end of the session and it should be done properly

the faculty is very fine but only needs to be improve in the teachings manner.
The faculty is very good but somewhere needs to be improve
the faculty should student to motivation

the institute should take care of the civil depatment also if you are motivate student than only sudent can grow
the only subject got completed properly
the proper labs should be there
The subject covers almost every aspect that it should.
the subject is devided in three parts so it become complicated to understand the subject.
the subject should be taught more practically than on slides.
The syllabus is adequate and is taught well.
"the syllabus is good, i think its too easy for an engineering student, we should be taught more practical theorems and concetps."
The syllabus should be less or the semester should be an odd sem for this subject so there's more time to learn the subject.
the syllabus should be taught by a single or at the most two teachers.
"the teacher should listen to the students needs and demands,should give practical example or hence be changed"
the worst thing is if v gonna make ED better we have to sacrifice with ALL OTHER subjects . 
thear are not sufisent to mst marks.......
there is no weakness in our teacher
there must be any favour hindi medium students
there should also be curriculam activities alongwith studies.student-teacher interection need to be enhanced so that student could feel freequestionig
there should be a prescribed book
there should be a teacher like him
there should be curriculam also
there should be one faculty for one subject. multiple teachers teaching the same subject creates confusion. 
there should be some practical related to the subject
thik 
this is a good subject must be taught well
This sem was shorter so the sylabus should have been made less
this semester was quite small so we couldn't gain as much as we could from him
this subject is very scoring as well as interesting to study.
this subject should be made a little bit easier 
this subject should have more practical lectures than theory!

Thoda aur badha ho jao`

two teachers must not be employed to teach the same subject.one teacher for one subject is enough.
