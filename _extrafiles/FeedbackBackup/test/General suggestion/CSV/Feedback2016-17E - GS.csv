high level question paper

i do not recommend him to teach the same sub to juniours ... though taking many feedback .. no action is taken 
I don't know why such teachers are there in a prestigious college like IET DAVV ........
I request IET Administration not to give him any subject to teach for the sake of student's future.  
i wish a mike was there in her class.... the end of her sentences can never be heard. a microphone would help
"I would be very happy to see him as the Director of the College, as he is best suited for the role."
ic desing
if he can explain things loudly
"if it is entrepreneurship, then let student write their ideas in answers do not force then to write what you have tought "
if possible can interact with practical examples or a example with ongoing technology basis.
improve chemistry lab allocate more lectures for practicals

in the subject she teach if she use projector and compile the programs she make in the class itself it will be more interactive and better.
In this some regular visits should be given to students .
inability to interact with students
inadequate time to learn anything

Include more practical examples and real life application of subject. Since Signal &amp; System and Analog communcation is almost same replace one of them.
increase  here salary

it is very laborious to write the whole book again in the file and doesnot make much sense
IT students should not be made to study EC subjects
it will good if he checks n design paper at moderate level instead of cutting marks on each every question unneccessorily
it's going very well.just if number of classes given to this subject are more it will be better.

the class of economics should be of 1 hour this is better option being class of 2 hours
"The classes given to this subject are no adequate, they should be more so that the syllabus goes more smoothly."
"The classes of him mainly consists of diagrams and theory , the real models of the diagrams should be shown to students and also in workshop the proper arrangement for making the models should be made."
the classrooms must be more innovative.
the course is very big as per time given for college
the curriculum should have something innovative rather than just solving questions and understanding them.
the guest facultiy Vijendra mishra was not punctual.
the number of classes given to this subjects should be more so that the syllabus goes more smoothly.
the number of classes of her should be increased.
the subject is nice but the way it is taught is not adequate.
the subject is very interesting if a knowledgable person teaches it.
"the subject should be given to the teacher which know about that subject , should not given to anyone"
the subject should be taught in more interesting manner
The syllabus is not offcially announced on the website for all the subject. It should be provided in advance
The syllabus should be revised
THE TEST MARKS DISTRIBUTION FOR QUESTIONS SHOULD BE IMPROVED
"the theory should be well taught , slowly and by making concepts clear instead of running to complete the course."
Theaching should be more  practically aimed rather than theoritical.
There Should be a very good faculty for DSP
There should be best faculty for this subject
There should be expert and master faculty in this subject because it is major one for us.
there should be logical numerical based question in exam
There should be some practical applications of topics being taught.
"There should be welding and foundry practicals,Because in the workshop we were not given proper equipments and time to do so, and if the theory and practical goes together we can understand the subject better "
there was no discussion of question paper
thesn 
this faculty should not teach any other subject
this is our core subject.....at least provide a puntual faculty
THIS IS SICK
"This lab could have been very interesting with a good teacher and correct way of teaching, but instead it is boring and dull"
this one is my favourite
This subject can be made much more interesting by including case studies of organization. 
this subject is merely a waste of time
this subject is of no use for it students.no one seem to be interested in this subject
this subject requires teaching on projectors and not on black board... it would be easy to understand and resolve doubts that way..
this teacher should be changed he is not able to teach properly his way of teaching is poor
timely complition of coarse is necessary
timetable  department should be given to him
timetable department should be given to him
